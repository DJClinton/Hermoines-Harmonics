## Team

- Hiroto Takeuchi
- Dakota Fedor
- Sahil Patel
- Ryan Symons
- Caity Kurutz


## Prerequisites

- Java 8=>11 (Make sure to have correct JAVA_HOME setup in your environment)
- Maven
- Run npm install in estore-ui/ folder


## How to run it

1. Clone the repository and go to the root directory.
2. Execute `mvn compile exec:java`
3. Open in your browser `http://localhost:8080/`
4.  _add any other steps required or examples of how to use/run_

## Known bugs and disclaimers
(It may be the case that your implementation is not perfect.)

Document any known bug or nuisance.
If any shortcomings, make clear what these are and where they are located.

## How to test it

The Maven build script provides hooks for run unit tests and generate code coverage
reports in HTML.

To run tests on all tiers together do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test jacoco:report`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

To run tests on a single tier do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test-compile surefire:test@tier jacoco:report@tier` where `tier` is one of `controller`, `model`, `persistence`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/{controller, model, persistence}/index.html`

To run tests on all the tiers in isolation do this:

1. Execute `mvn exec:exec@tests-and-coverage`
2. To view the Controller tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`
3. To view the Model tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`
4. To view the Persistence tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`

*(Consider using `mvn clean verify` to attest you have reached the target threshold for coverage)
  
  
## How to generate the Design documentation PDF

1. Access the `PROJECT_DOCS_HOME/` directory
2. Execute `mvn exec:exec@docs`
3. The generated PDF will be in `PROJECT_DOCS_HOME/` directory
